<p><b><big>Before you start:</big></b><br>
        </p>
               
<p><font color="#990000">Many kernels and Linux distributions already come 
with ov511 preinstalled.    To check whether it is installed, run "modprobe 
ov511" as root. If you don't   get any errors, then the driver is already 
installed. Skip to the   "<b>Loading and Using the Driver</b>" section below.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font color="#990000"></font></p>

               
<p>These built-in drivers usually work, but may not be the most recent version.
    You may need to install a more recent driver if:<br>
        </p>
               
<ul>
             <li>You want to use an OV518 camera (<b>Creative WebCam Mini</b>, model PD0040 or <b>Philips PCVC720K</b>). Note: These cameras <b>REQUIRE</b>
  the ov518_decomp module to be loaded.<br>
   </li>
   <li>You want to use compression support for higher frame rates  (requires 
  version 1.41)</li>
             <li>You have a device that is not supported by older drivers 
(Lifeview   CapView, camera with OV6620 sensor, etc...)</li>
             <li>You enjoy having the latest version of everything :-)<br>
          </li>
               
</ul>
              <b><font size="+1">Installing the driver:</font></b> 
<ol>
   <li>Make sure you have a compiler and kernel source that matches your
currently running kernel.<br>
   </li>
   <li>Be sure that your kernel supports USB. If it doesn't, see my <a href="kernel_install.html">
 kernel installation instructions</a>.</li>
   <li><a href="download.html">Download the </a><a href="download.html">latest 
driver</a>.</li>
   <li>Decompress it. For example, "<tt>tar xvzf ov511-1.58.tar.gz</tt>".</li>
   <li>Change to the directory that got created, e.g. "<tt>cd ov511-1.58</tt>
".</li>
   <li>Run "<tt>make</tt>". If you get errors about include files, edit Makefile 
and set "<tt>INCLUDEDIR=/<i>path_to_kernel_source</i>/include</tt>".</li>
   <li>If you have a 2.4 or 2.5 kernel, run "<tt>make install</tt>". That will list the available install options for your kernel. Run whichever one matches your kernel best.</li>
 
</ol>
 <b><font size="+1">Loading and using the driver:</font></b>            
                                                                  
<ol>
                       <li>Become root. Eg: "<tt>su -</tt>"<br>
   </li>
   <li>Load USB support:<br>
   </li>
   
  <ol>
     <li>See which type of USB controller you have with "<tt>lspci</tt>".</li>
     <li>For UHCI controllers, either "<tt>modprobe usb-uhci</tt>" <b>OR</b>
  "<tt>modprobe uhci</tt>". They are equivalent, but one might work better 
for you than the other.</li>
     <li>For OHCI controllers, "<tt>modprobe usb-ohci</tt>".</li>
     <li>If these modules don't exist, it's possible that USB is built into 
your kernel. Also, on 2.5 kernels, the drivers are called uhci-hcd and ohci-hcd.<br>
     </li>
   
  </ol>
                        <li> Make sure that USB is working: Check that <tt>
  /proc/bus/usb/devices</tt>         exists and contains data. If it doesn't
 exist, don't worry: "Preliminary USB device filesystem" is probably not
enabled in your kernel config, or usbdevfs isn't mounted. This won't affect
the ov511 driver, but it makes problems harder to diagnose.</li>
                        <li> Load <tt>ov511</tt>: "<tt>modprobe ov511</tt>".  This  should also automatically   load the "videodev" (Video4Linux) module
  if you  have one.</li>
                        <li> Make sure the driver is working: When you run
 the   "<tt>dmesg</tt>"   command, you should see some messages from ov511
 telling   you which kind of  bridge and sensor chips your camera uses. If
 you see errors  from ov511, report  them to me.</li>
                        <li> Check that <tt>/dev/video0</tt>      exists. 
If it doesn't, you can create it with "<tt>mknod /dev/video0   c 81 0</tt>
". If you have another video device, you camera might be on      <tt>/dev/video1</tt>
  (change the last argument to <tt>mknod</tt> to 1 in that case).</li>
                     <li>Some applications look for the device at <tt>  /dev/video</tt>
 . In some operating systems (e.g. RedHat 7.1),                  
   <tt>  /dev/video</tt>     might be a directory and not  a device node
or a symbolic  link. You will   have to manually specify the  device as <tt>
 /dev/video0</tt>   when you use  your video application.<br>
            </li>
                        <li> Give users (besides root) permission to use
the   camera.  This requires   read and write access to <tt>/dev/video0</tt>
 . You   can grant this permission  with "<tt>chmod  666 /dev/video0</tt>
". If you don't want everyone on your system to be able to use the camera,
use the "chown" command <u>instead</u> to make /dev/video0 belong to you.</li>
                        <li> Download an application from <a href="http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/apps.html">
          http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/apps.html</a>      and test it. I 
recommend   Xawtv and Vidcat. (Note: vidcat might not work on cameras with OV6620 or OV6630 sensors).</li>

<font size="+1"><small>Compression support will give you better
frame rates with OV511 cameras, and is <b>REQUIRED</b> with OV518 cameras.
It requires lots of CPU power, and reduces the image quality somewhat, though.
If you want/need it, do the following: <br>
