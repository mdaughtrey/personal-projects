260303 - Start ov519 and ov8610 on the basis of ov511 driver version 1.6
         Rename ov511 to ov51x to avoid confusion of the user.

         file 86108.set

020403 - Got Hardware. PID is 0x3519.
         Windows driver did not recognize the device.
         Remove RA7, RA8. Set RB7, RB8 to 10k to have PID 0x0519.
         Windows driver recognizes device and starts initialization.
         Add "EnableSystem" and "SetUsbInit" to ov519_configure.
       ! The driver claimes the devices now.
         Add changes to ov51x_init_isoc, ov51x_stop_isoc.
         Add changes to ov51x_stop, ov51x_restart.
030403 - Found SOF header and JPEG header.
         Add changes to ov519_move_data.
040403 - Add changes to get_frame_length.
         Found EOF header.
         Figure out the meaning of SOF and EOF header
         Add changes to ov519_move_data.
         Got first JPEG at user space. Hurray!!!
050403 - Add changes to set_ov_sensor_window.
         Write a tool getjpeg to grep the JPEGs.
         Add framerate setting to ov519_mode_init_regs.
         Add ov->compress=1 to ov519_configure.
         Add changes to ov519_move_data to prevent bad frame moving.
         Add changes to request_decompressor.
         Add changes to hwXbase and vwXbase in set_ov_sensor_window.
         Add mmap support to getjpeg. Now full framerate is possible.
060403 - Add changes to sensor_set_auto_brightness.
         Add changes to sensor_set_auto_exposure.
         Add changes to sensor_set_backlight.
         Add changes to sensor_set_mirror.
         Add changes to get- and set-routines for contrast, brightness, saturation and hue.
         Figure out that setting register 0x6c bit 7 of sensor prevents the first images being red.
         Add length / 8 to first two bytes of frame data.
080403 - Try to set reg 0x5c of ov519 to 0x01 for 12MHz clock, but driver failed. So leave it untouched.
110403 - Remove RB4 and set RA4 to 10k. Now the windows driver works.
120403 - Transfer optimized windows settings to linux driver and test it.
         Add module parameter framerate and jpeginfo.
250104 - (version 1.09-mark, Mark McClelland)
	 Added initial OV7640 and EyeToy support
	 Changed getjpeg.c default resolution to 640x480
	 Disable sensor_set_* functions as a temporary hack (missing log entry
	   added on 250304)
250304 - (version 1.10-mark, Mark McClelland)
	 Add OV519 LED support and clean up ov51x_led_control().
	 Add 05a9:8519 USB IDs.
 	 Fix OV66xx detection to distinguish between 66307 and 66308/AE/AF
	 Update compression instructions in README about supported applications.
	 doc/readme.txt: s/ov511/ov51x where appropriate
	 Check entire low OV76[34]x version byte. Add OV7645/7645B/7648 as a
	    consequence. Some OV763x sensors may need to be explicitly added.
	 Finished EyeToy support:
	   Added led2 parameter and ioctls for EyeToy.
	   Change default frame rate to -1 (maximum possible for current
              resolution/sensor/etc...).
	   Add controls for OV7640 brightness/contrast/saturation/hue/exposure.
	   Add OV7640 light frequency control.
	   Explicitly disable unsupported OV7640 settings:
	      - sensor_set_auto_brightness()
	      - sensor_set_backlight()
	   Implement sensor_set_auto_gain() (for OV7640 only, so far).
	   Add OV7640 sensor_set_auto_exposure() support.
	   Fix OV519 clock support:  clock now determined by framerate
	   Implement OV7640 resolution selection; remove existing 640x480 hacks.
	   Framerate register & clock settings depend on sensor type now. Add
	      initial OV7640 framerate code.
	   Add ov->imp so we can distinguish between vendor-specific camera
	      implementations. Use this to handle EyeToy LED differences.

210804 - (version 1.11-mark, Mark McClelland)
	 Add 2.6 kernel support (thanks to Erik van Konijnenburg for many
	 of these fixes):
	   Add 2.6 kernel support to Makefile
	   Don't EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS in decomp code on 2.6 kernel
	   Disable /proc support for 2.6
	   Switch to dynamic video_device allocation, for kobject lifetime
	      rules copmliance
	   Update module linkage code for 2.6
	   Add 2.6 compatibility inline functions (video_get_drvdata(), etc...)
	   Support 2.6 USB API changes (device/interface restructuring)
	   Miscellaneous 2.6 compatibility fixes
	 Set TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE before sleeping
	 Add new Eyetoy and generic OV519 product IDs
	 Fix PDEBUG macro for newer compilers
	 Fix missing ov519_init_compression() call
