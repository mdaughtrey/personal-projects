OV51x USB Webcam Driver for 2.2, 2.4, and 2.5 kernels

More thorough installation instructions are available in:
doc/install.html
or at:
http://alpha.dyndns.org/ov511/install.html

Quick Installation:

	make clean
	make
	(log in as root)
	make install	(Gives a list of the supported installation types)
	(run the appropriate install command)

Compression support:

 - For OV511/OV511+ cameras: The decompression module is ov511_decomp.o . You
   must load ov511.o with the "compress=1" module parameter to enable it.

 - For OV518/OV518+ cameras: The decompression module is ov518_decomp.o .
   Compression will always be enabled; no need to specify compress=1.

 - For all cameras: You must load the decompressor AFTER loading ov51x, and you
   must unload the decompressor BEFORE unloading ov51x. You will get errors
   otherwise.

 - For OV519 cameras: Standard JPEG Compression is used. You need an
   application that supports this. Only the included test/getjpeg program does
   so far as I know.

Please see doc/ov51x.txt for more information.
