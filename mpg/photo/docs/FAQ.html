<blockquote> A: Well, the coolness is natural, I make the scripts free
cuz I learned most of what I know from open source software so as I
learn, I give back what I created along the way.&nbsp; Also, I sure do
hope that you remember me when you are looking for someone to write
custom scripts for you. Just email me <a
 href="mailto:mike@fuzzymonkey.org">mike@fuzzymonkey.org</a> for a quote
:-) </blockquote>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><font color="#ffffff"> Q: I just pointed my browswer at one of
the scripts and it says <b>"Internal Sever Error 400"</b> or something
similar!  Your scripts suck! </font></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<blockquote> A: Well, this could be any error.  The best way to see what
is going on is to look at your web server error log.&nbsp; On many
linux systems this is in the /var/log/httpd/ directory.<br>
  <br>
If you do not have access to your web serer error log, you can find out
lots of information by running it from command line.  You will want to
telnet or ssh into your server.  Then `cd` to the directory containing
the .cgi script.  To run it, do:
  <p>$ ./scriptname.cgi <i>(where scriptname.cgi is the name of the
script</i> </p>
  <p>Depending on the webserver, it may now ask you to enter name=value
pairs. At this point, just hit CNTL-D and it will output a combination
of HTML and/or errors.  If you want to test the script with giving it
input parameters (e.g. the stuff from forms) then you would enter those
name=value pairs first, one per line, and then hit CNTL-D.<br>
  </p>
  <p>If it doesn't ask you to enter in the name=value pairs, you can
edit the <span style="font-weight: bold;">use CGI;</span> like to say <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">use CGI qw(-debug);</span>.<br>
  </p>
  <p>If this info is not helpful, some commone reasons for getting this
error are: </p>
  <li>not having permissions on the .cgi scripts set to 755 (chmod 755
filename.cgi) </li>
  <li>not having perl installed at /usr/bin/perl (see the next
question) </li>

    <tr>
      <td><font color="#ffffff"> Q: I just tried to execute the script
and it says that the <b>file cannot be found</b> or that it can't find
perl! </font></td>

<blockquote> A: Check to make sure you have perl installed and in
/usr/bin/perl.&nbsp; You can do this by doing:
  <p>$ whereis perl </p>
  <p>this should tell you where perl is installed.  If it is not
installed, install it from <a href="http://www.perl.com">www.perl.com</a>.
If it is somewhere besides /usr/bin/perl then change the first line of
the script to reflect where it is installed.<br>
  </p>
  <p>If the script says "file not found" or "no such file or directory"
this could be becuse the file is a DOS text file or was uploaded in the
wrong mode.<br>
  </p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><font color="#ffffff"> Q: The script just complained about not
having <b>permissions to read, write</b>, or something similar!

<blockquote> A:  The problem is that the script you are running needs to
read or write to files which it doesn't have access to.  Normally,
these files are written in the same directory where the script is or
some other directory that you specified when you set the script up. 
When your script executes, it gets under a certain user account.  If
you are running an apache server, this is most likely  the user
'apache' or 'nobody'.  There are a few ways to fix this:
  <p> </p>
  <li>You could be really cool and get a <a
 href="http://www.fuzzymonkey.org/igwig/">web hosting account from me</a>
and you wouldn't have to worry about it cuz my server is set up properly
:-) </li>
  <li>You can install suexec and reinstall apache.  This will make sure
that all scripts are run as the user who has the web account.  This is
how most commercial servers are set up. </li>
  <li>You can change the owner for the folders that contains the script
and files you want to run.&nbsp; For instance, if the webserver
executes them as 'apache' you could just (make sure you use the paths
to the folders you want to change):
    <p>$ chown -R apache /var/www/html/photo<br>
$ chown -R apache /var/www/cgi-bin/photo </p>
  </li>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><font color="#ffffff"> Q: When I run the script it says: <b>Unable
to find something/something.pm in @INC</b> or something similar!  Whats
up? </font></td>

<blockquote> A: That means that you do not have one of the requires perl
modules installed. Don't worry, that is an easy fix ... just install
the perl module :-)
  <p>If you have root access, just go to <a
 href="http://search.cpan.org">search.cpan.org</a>, download it, perl
Makefile.PL;make;make install </p>
  <p>If you don't have root access (e.g. you have a hosting account you
pay for by month), then you have 2 options: </p>
  <li>You can buy some beer for your server admin or email your hosting
company to see if they will install it for you.  Unless they are a mega
company, they probably will. </li>
  <li>You can install it locally on your account.  This may take up
some of your precious MB's (web space), but this is what I do here at
fuzzymonkey.  Just read the instructions in README.IMAGEMAGICK or email
me for a copy if you dont have one.  Normally, this is just as easy as
using PREFIX=/home/user/cgi-bin/local when you configure or make
anything that you want to install locally.  If you do choose this
method, then make sure you add the uselib lines to the top of your
scripts so that they know where to find the locally installed modules. 
I use the following:
    <p> use lib
"/home/username/www/cgi-bin/local/lib/site_perl/5.6.0/i686-linux/";
#ImageMagick use lib "/home/username/www/cgi-bin/local/lib/site_perl/";
#Image::Info and IO::String </p>
  </li>
