Same recipe as before except using tapioca starch – 1 part glycerine, 3 parts starch, 2 parts white vinegar and 14 parts water. I expect to get some wizened old gingerbread crones but you never know. They might be good for Halloween. Now I think of it you could cover a woolly mitten in this stuff and when it dried it might look like a gnarly old hand. Or cover a rose in it…that might be cool in a Nightmare Before Christmas kind of way.
