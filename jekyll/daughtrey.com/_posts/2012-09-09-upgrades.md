So I’ve done a couple of conversions with the current setup and it’s apparent that I need to make a few changes.  
The first is the camera; my digital SLR took about 18,000 frames for 2 films and that’s really bad for the mechanical systems. So I’m now using this Samsung NX200 mirror less unit. It’s around 20 megapixels and has an APS-C sensor.

However, it doesn’t have a remote shutter connection (which I should have checked out) so I built this mechanical actuator.

It’s a block of balsa which fits snugly over the camera. On the top is a relay and solenoid which mechanically activates the shutter.
