This is a module I’m working on for the son of a friend. It’s an [ISD1932 Voice Record Module](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9579) from [Sparkfun](http://sparkfun.com) driven by an Atmel AT90S4433 microcontroller. The micro is currently hooked up to a tilt sensor and will be shortly connected to these [piezo vibration sensors](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9198). It’ll trigger the lightsaber sounds as the module is moved around and bumped.
