While I was working on my [Furry Friends](http://daughtrey.com/?cat=16) project for Halloween I had the need to program 12 Atmel ATTiny45 chips before I soldered them up. I could have programmed them in-circuit but then I thought of this.

Enter [Sugru](http://sugru.com/).   I drilled a couple of registration holds on either side of the SOIC pads on the board. Then I glued a chip to the board with carpenters glue and put a dollop of Sugru on top of it and let it set. |

Then I pulled out the chip and trimmed it up a bit.

Sugru!
