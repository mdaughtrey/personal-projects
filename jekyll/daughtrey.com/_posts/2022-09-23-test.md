# A mask-mounted e-paper display, controlled from your phone.

## Mask Construction

A fairly simple design done in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/). It’s two parts; The cyan clip fits over the yellow assembly. The parts are printed in PLA so I glued the two parts together with dichloromethane solvent (available as [Scigrip 16](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=scigrip+16&crid=1GZGEW2J5Q9K3&sprefix=scigrip%2Caps%2C133&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_2_7) at Amazon) and then cut the mask fabric out. The design file is [here](https://github.com/mdaughtrey/openscad/blob/master/bluemouth/bluemouth.scad)

## Display Installation
Here is the mounted e-paper display with an adapter board also acting as strain relief:.

## E-Paper Display and Driver
The e-paper display is a 2.9inch flexible display from [Waveshare ](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-2/2.9inch-e-paper-d.htm)and [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32922604788.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.798f72759DOwkb&algo_pvid=0bf8d789-ec06-4d99-8209-729a705f2530&algo_expid=0bf8d789-ec06-4d99-8209-729a705f2530-0&btsid=0bb0624216031648794658905e68db&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_)
That connects to an ESP32 E-Paper driver board ([Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000804064988.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.148b4c4dXyq1Qj)). It’s an ESP32-WROOM-32 module with connector hardware.
