I was left with more mobility than I thought I’d have, which is awesome. Here are the keys embedded into a lump of [Sugru](http://www.sugru.com). This is a moldable material that hardens into a firm silicone-type material (I think). It’s good for giving the buttons a little bounce. Once that’s set up I’ll cover the rest of the keyboard in heatshrink to make it a little more robust.
