I just bought this DSO kit by [JYE Tech](http://jyetech.com). It’s got a 5MHz capture rate which translates to about 1MHz of useful bandwidth, which is pretty cool and plenty for my needs, which is mostly capturing pulse trains while I’m developing something. The photo shows development of a controller for the RC heli motors I mentioned a couple of posts back. There are a few sources for the kit, I got mine at  
[Sparkfun](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9484). They also have another cool looking DSO [here](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9625).
