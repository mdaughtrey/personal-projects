Let’s see if I’m going to be sufficiently motivated to keep this updated. I’ll be posting updates on my latest projects (the majority of which I will never finish), funny/odd things that I encounter in NYC (with pictures where available) and observations which at least I find hugely entertaining.

The latest funny thing is that I carried [this guy](http://twitter.com/mmalkoff) from 65th to 70th street to help him in his effort to be carried the length of Manhattan. He’s making a video of it and I’ve started writing my autobiography in anticipation of the media frenzy.
