hey, remember [this](http://daughtrey.com/?p=362 "this")? After only 18 months my [Kickstarter](http://kickstarter.com "Kickstarter")-funded flashlight has arrived. It’s called the [Hexbright](http://hexbright.com "Hexbright"). As you might think, it’s very bright, but cooler than that is that it has a programmable microcontroller and an accelerometer so you can use gestures or taps to make it do things.
