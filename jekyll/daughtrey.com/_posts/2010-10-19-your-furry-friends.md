Here is this year’s Halloween project. The picture is of an ATTiny45 driving a couple of LEDs via PWM to make them periodically fade up, blink at you for a while and then shut off. It’s running on a 2016 coin cell which gets me about 18 hours of use (not bad). I’m going to make 10 or so of these and put them in some my daughter’s old stuffed animals. Then I’m going to put them all together and have them collectively stare and blink at you. There are two obstacles;  
1\. Time  
2\. My wife, who isn’t keen on me mutilating perfectly good stuffed animals. I may have to skulk around the foggy streets and playgrounds of our town in a cape, looking for victims.
