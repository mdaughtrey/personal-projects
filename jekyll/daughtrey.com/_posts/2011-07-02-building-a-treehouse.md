Here’s a treehouse designed I worked on over the winter which I’m finally getting around to building. I spent a lot of time looking on the web for designs but the most useful resource was a book called “The Complete Guide: Build Your Kids a Treehouse” which is by Black &amp; Decker. Then I worked it all out with Sketchup.
