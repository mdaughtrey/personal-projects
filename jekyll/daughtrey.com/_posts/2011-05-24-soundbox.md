I’m building a sound effects box based on the legendary (to those in the know (geeks)) [Texas Instruments SN76477 Sound Effects Generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_SN76477). This chip was responsible for most video arcade game sound in the 80s and it’s versatility always impressed me. So I got the chip and am building a sound effects generator around it.

Here is the front panel and the start of the internal wiring
