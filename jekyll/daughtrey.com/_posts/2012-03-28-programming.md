Here is the Attiny45 hooked up to the header which will connect to my programmer. Below that is the programmer itself. The perfboard integrates the AVR ISP and a USB-to-serial converter into a single header which I use for my ATMega169 development. This project is trivial enough that I can use my scope for troubleshooting.
