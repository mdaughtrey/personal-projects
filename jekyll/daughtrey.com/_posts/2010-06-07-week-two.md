I’m out of the splint and into a brace. My fingers have room to move which is great but my arm is pretty swollen and very weak. I got yelled at by my physical therapist for lifting my arm just a tiny bit so it’s really not ready for action yet.  
Luckily the Stumptronic 2000 is working well. My typing has really improved although it’s still only about half as fast as I normally type. It’s comfortable and I can rest my left hand on my lap while I type.  
I also put stickers on the keyboard showing the mirrored mode.
