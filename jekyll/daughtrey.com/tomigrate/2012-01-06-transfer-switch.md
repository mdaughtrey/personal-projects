Over the last year we’ve had a long time without power; between Hurricane Irene and the blizzard in October we’ve been dark for about 7 days. This is bad enough in the summer (losing a freezer full of food is expensive) but it’s really serious in the winter (frozen pipes are Bad News). So we bought a generator and I’m modifying our house wiring so we can run the essentials from it.

Here are two of the three boxes I’m making. Pretty simple really, just a switch, a breaker and a recessed male socket for the generator cord.
