<title>Halloween Eyes</title>
</head><body>

<p>Halloween Eyes is the first project using the LMDriver platform I've been working on, on and off, for about 4 years. The concept is simple; a pair of TERRIFYING disembodied eyes rendered on a 4 5x7 dot matrix displays which look about and blink every so often. Check out the demo video on YouTube. Even though I was going for "terrifying", the most common reaction was "cute". Yeah, cute like a GHOST.

<p>The whole thing is based around 2 complete LMDriver modules, and a microcontroller steps them through sequence.

Each module is driven by an Atmel ATMega169 microcontroller and nothing else. The uC accepts an extensive command set and handles the multiplexing of the displays. The displays are heavily multiplexed; each LED matrix has a maximum of 2 LEDs on simultaneously. The LED displays are dual color but I'm not using green for this project; the next one will.

In this picture the display is being driver by a single AA battery and an iPod charger that I picked up at CVS for $1.99 after last Christmas. It outputs 5v which is perfect for testing this out.

The programming is done via a tinyisp module from adafruit.org. Here you can see it attached to the eyes module, along with the module development jig next to it.

As an example of how easy the LMDriver is to use, here's the code that steps through the sequence
