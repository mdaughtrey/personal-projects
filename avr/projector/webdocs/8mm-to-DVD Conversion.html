<h1><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId521879"></a>Introduction</h1>
8mm film in general holds a special place in my heart because it
was the first motion capture medium that was available to the ordinary
person.&nbsp; You can get an idea of how revolutionary this was when it
was
introduced in the 60s by the behaviour of the people in front of and
behind the camera. Many of the scenes captured on these films (here's
my car, here's me waving) wouldn't warrant the few megabytes they would
consume on today's memory cards but they were noteworthy then because
of the sheer novelty of the medium.&nbsp; The great thing about this is
that
40 years later we can look back into time and see fascinating details
in mundane scenes; the cars, the clothing and the incredibly dangerous
toys we let our kids play with. Add to that the saturated color,
scratches, lines, errant hairs and it's easy to see why it's become the
metaphor of choice for modern movies that want to wistfully look back
into the past. Everything about it has become iconic.<br>
<br>
My father was very much into photography and 8mm films when we were
kids. As well as the usual holiday shots frolicking about on the beach
and waving our ice creams around I recall having to stand still while
Dad took a frame, then move a bit, another frame and so on. You sent
the film in, waited a week or so and then gathered the family around in
the dark to watch an awkward 13-year-old travel about the yard without
moving his legs. ** image animated gif **<br>
<br>
My two brothers and I made our own contributions, culminating in a
brief stop-motion-animated tale of an explosion in the street and the
valiant efforts of the repair crew, long know as "The Playmobil Movie".
It took so long to shoot that you
can see the shadows move as the movie plays and my brother grew by
about a half inch.<br>
<br>
All things must pass, however, and 8mm projectors have gone the way of
the dinosaur. Even when they were the T. Rex of the media playback
world they were short-tempered, finicky beasts and the viewing session
that didn't include burnt fingers, burnt plastic, a blown bulb or
damaged film was a rare one. Nowadays you'd pay big bucks for a movie
experience like that.<br>
<br>
On to the future, then...<br>
<br>
Modern 8mm conversion options basically come in two flavors:<br>
1. A high quality conversion service with a dedicated and very
expensive machine that performs conversion and color correction. These
produce a very nice result but most places charge by the film foot and
the cost of doing more than a few films gets prohibitive.<br>
2. The do-it-yourself device that is basically a mirror and a couple of
lenses. You put the project in one end and your video camera in the
other and literally videotape the film. This is very cheap, in both
senses. Your quality is limited by your video camera and the quality of
the mirror and lenses. Additionally if you don't match the video camera
shutter speed with the projector's frame rate, your video copy will
have flicker.<br>
<br>
Here then is a system which creates a flicker-free video file with
better than HD quality which can be downscaled to HD, DVD, YouTube,
whatever you like. I've also described some of the interesting
sidetracks I took and how they led to my design decisions. The least
developed part of the system is the color processing and cleanup of the
video. I'd like to look into that at some point and have some links
listed below.<br>
<br>
This is a block diagram of the system.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 708px; height: 539px;" alt="Hardware Block Diagram" title="Hardware Block Diagram" src="Hardware%20Block%20Diagram.png"><br>
<br>
<h1><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId369311"></a>Projector Hardware</h1>
<br>
The hardware is based around a Bell and Howell 245 PA that I purchased
from Ebay. The brand and model don't matter at all since you're only
using it for its mechanics, as shown below. The bulb and cooling fan
have been removed and the power cord cut. In my case I found the
projector lens was unusable since something bad had happened to the
lens coatings and the entire lens was fogged (something they're
notorious for apparently). Replacements are
easily found though. I got mine at xxxxx link xxxxxx.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 600px; height: 450px;" alt="Stripped Bell and Howell 245 PA" title="Stripped Bell and Howell 245 PA" src="projector_stripped.JPG"><br>
<br>
<br>
<h1><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId689907"></a>Motor Drive</h1>
There are a few options for motor drive.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control of the existing AC motor.</li>
  <li>Installing a DC gearhead motor with a simple relay control to
drive
the motor shaft.</li>
  <li>A stepper motor plus driver to drive the shaft.</li>
</ol>
<br>
If I was doing this again I'd drive the existing AC motor. It requires
the least mechanical intervention. I went with the stepper motor
because I didn't know what the motor would be required to do and how
fast, and since the microcontroller drives the motor at a low level I
could make adjustments via software. Also I knew that I'd be taking it
to pieces and reassembling it multiple times as I installed parts of
the system, and having non-lethal voltages around seemed like a good
idea.<br>
<br>
If I was going to go the stepper route again I'd use a less precise
motor. I used a 1.8 degree/step motor which is fairly typical but turns
out to be way more precise than I needed (about 18 degrees/step would
have been fine), and because of that you can't drive it nearly as fast
as you could the original AC motor. This means you can't fast forward,
rewind or even play at normal speed. It's a minor nuisance for the 25ft
3 minute films, but there are 200ft and 400ft films out there also.<br>
<br>

It's really good value for money, about US$9. It's using TIP 127 and
TIP122 FETs which are hardly the cutting edge but they do a great job
here. If you were running them continuously they'd need active cooling
but for me they're only running for 1 second every 3 and just get a
little warm. The board also has the nice feature of an onboard 5v
regulator so you can feed the rest of your logic from whatever voltage
you picked to drive the motor. I haven't noticed any spiking issues.<br>
Here's the stepper driver installed and connected to the motor. The
motor is a unipolar (6 wires) but I'm ignoring the center taps
and using it in bipolar configuration. The motor only puts out half
its rated power in this mode because you're driving two coils in
series (with twice the resistance) but in this case it had juice
to spare.<br>

The heart of the system is an Atmel AVR ATMega 169
microcontroller. I'm
a big fan of the AVR micros; Linux supports a very capable toolchain
plus they have an their incredible range of on-chip devices. Also the
generous sample-giving-out policy helped a lot when I was broke. I'm
into the 169 in
particular because I tend to build projects that need a lot of I/O. The
Microchip PIC is also a worthy contender and Atmel themselves have come
up with more powerful chips but I have a couple of hundred 169s sitting
in my basement plus about 160 circuit boards for them, so I guess I'll
be sticking with them for a while.<br>
<br>
There is no reason that you couldn't replace the main board with a link
to
the computer's parallel port, aside from not being able to drive the
stepper motor as fast. The system has only 1 hardware input, everything
else is output.&nbsp; The advantage of this system though is that it
presents itself to the PC as a USB serial port and so can be controlled
from any terminal communications program or script (as I will show
later), plus needs no proprietary connections to the computer.
Therefore you can run it on any PC, any OS (I run it via linux).<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId550768"></a>USB Serial Interface</h2>
Also on the main board is an <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/FTProducts.htm#FT232R" target="_blank">FTDI
FT232R</a> USB-to-serial converter chip,
which has been a breeze to use. It appears to the host computer as a
serial port and has a simple receive/transmit pair for the
microcontroller. This makes interfacing to the board platform
independent since you can drive it from any terminal communications
program.<br>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId340379"></a>LCD </h2>
The LCD (from <a href="http://www.goldmine-elec.com/" target="_blank">Electronics
Goldmine</a>) on the mainboard is basically
unused right now. I did have this
idea early on of making the projector standalone with the LCD showing a
frame count and a simple keyboard to kick off the conversion process.
However since I'm knee deep in PCs most of the time it wouldn't buy me
much.<br>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId937212"></a>Camera Relay</h2>
My original idea for the camera trigger was to get a camera that could
take photos via commands from its USB port and drive that with gphoto2
on Linux. I had some candidate cameras in my junk drawer for that
purpose. The potentially cool thing about was that when the camera's
memory card became full the pictures would be downloaded to the
computer and the camera could then resume its work. The problem was
that cameras that could be remotely controlled AND support file
transfer without a power restart and faking the presence or absence of
the USB connection was by no means universal and I wanted the option to
upgrade cameras with minimal impact. This suggested a simpler "remote
switch" that would trigger the camera as if the shutter had been
pressed. As it turned out the time between my coming up with this idea
and now was about 5 years, and in that time digital cameras changed a
lot. I recently purchased my first DSLR (a Canon EOS 500D which I
*love*) and it has a simple 3.5mm jack for the remote control switch. A
little bit of Googling turned up the wiring diagram for it and so it
was simple to have the microcontroller drive the relay closed for 100ms
and have the camera take the picture. As for running out of memory
that's become much less than of an issue. The camera has a 16GB SD card
and even with a 15 megapixel image consuming 5 MB for each frame,
that's 5MB x 16 fps x 180 seconds = 14.4 GB. A little close but no
biggie, and of course you can stop the system and transfer the image
files anytime. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId316544"></a>Lamp</h2>
I replaced the lamp with a 3 Watt white LED from <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com" target="_blank">dealextreme.com</a>
for all the usual reasons; the original bulb is hot, delicate and
expensive. I bought the voltage converter along with it to make
interfacing easier. The lamp is turned on by the lamp relay from the
main
board. The voltage converter has an upper bound of 7.2v and I happened
to have a power supply of just that voltage, so the LED got its own
power supply. This means that the project actually uses two power
supplies
but it was a lot easier than coming up with a high current voltage
regulator. The LED assembly is soldered to a piece of copper clad board
which acts as a heatsink.<br>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId786765"></a>IR LED and IR Sensor</h2>
The IR LED and sensor are mounted on each side of the projector wheel
and count off how many times the spokes of the wheel pass between them.
This is how I know when to stop and motor with the film frame correctly
positioned.<br>

The software is really basic. There's a main loop which looks for
commands on the serial port and handles the low-level stepper motor
signals, plus it controls the lamp and camera relays and monitors the
IR sensor.<br>

<h1><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId467030"></a>Projection Screen</h1>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId133386"></a>Front or Rear
Projection?</h2>
This
actually turned into the most time consuming part of the project. My
research for this turned up some pretty interesting stuff.&nbsp; I
initially thought front projection would be a good way to go as you
could just project onto a piece of paper or a white piece of plastic
and take a picture of each frame. One consequence of using a 3 Watt LED
as a projection light is that the project cannot throw the image nearly
as far as it could with its original bulb. Therefore the camera has to
be close to the project to capture the image. When you do that then you
have to be aware of what the projection screen is made of. If it's
white paper then a high resolution photograph is going to capture the
fibers that make up the paper, which is obviously undesirable. <br>
<br>
The other problem with front projection is that the projector and
camera can never be on the same axis which means that the&nbsp; picture
has a "keystone" effect where one side of the image is longer than the
other.&nbsp; You could adjust the projector, camera and screen to
adjust for this but if you get it slightly wrong you don't get a square
image, which you wouldn't discover until you examined the pictures.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 400px; height: 267px;" alt="Keystone" title="Keystone" src="keystone.jpg"><br>
<br>
&nbsp; I could have used a similar assembly to the DIY projection
systems which reflect off of a mirror at a 45 degree angle to "bend"
the image 90 degrees but you'd need a decent front surface mirror, and
I want to minimize the number of parts involved if possible.<br>
<br>
So then I thought....<br>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId462353"></a>Rear Projection</h2>
Although
getting the axes right in rear projection is easy, you run
into a different set of problems in choosing what to project onto. With
front projection all you need is a fairly smooth white surface; a
decent quality paper sheet or an opaque white shopping bag is fine.
With rear projection you have to project <span style="font-style: italic;">through</span> the screen.&nbsp; As I
mentioned above the camera has to be fairly close to the projection
screen but you don't want to pick up what the screen is made of. I
looked into ground, etched and frosted glass. Not only are these are
expensive and delicate they still have a structure if you look at them
under a magnifying glass.<br>
<br>
So how do the pros do it? They <span style="font-weight: bold;">vibrate
the screen</span>. You set the shutter speed of your camera to a
reasonable
fraction of a second and the projection screen blurs out while the
image stays in the same place. <span style="font-style: italic;">Genius</span>.<br>
<br>
Building a vibrating system is a bit of an undertaking so I decided to
try spinning instead. I buy CDs in bulk packs and the top one is
usually just the polycarbonate disk without the dye; it's completely
clear. The idea was that I'd glue some translucent plastic sheet (like
from a shopping bag) to the disk and spin it while projecting the image
on the screen. First up I needed to see how smooth I could get the
plastic....<br>

      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Here is the plastic on a regular
CD-R. It's not obvious here but it wasn't that smooth, unfortunately.
The plastic bubbled up a bit. I
was going to refine my process when I decided to shine the image on the
transparent part of the disc next to the hole. Although the image shone
on the plastic sheet quite nicely it also bounced around inside the
polycarbonate disc a few times with the result looking like double
vision. Also
the space available on the CD to project onto was too small for me to
focus on with my camera (no macro lens). So, CDs were out. <br>

Here's the first cut of a regular projection screen. The criteria for
success here is:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Not so thin that you can see the glow of the LED in the middle of
the image</li>
  <li>Not so thick that the image gets muddy</li>
  <li>Doesn't show its "grain", ie what it's made up of</li>
</ol>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">This is plastic from a heavy
duty shopping bag stretched over a wooden frame (which is&nbsp; a
square shelf-type thing). This is actually working quite nicely. As
you can see it has various creases and lumps but my image only took up
a small part of the screen so I focussed on a good part. I might hit it
with the heat gun to see if that smooths it out, or just stretch it on
four sides instead of just two.<br>
      <br>
I've just come into possession of a broken flat screen television and
it has some plastic sheets for diffusing the LCD backlight so I'll give
that a try soon.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> nah; the
diffusion sheets come out all sparkly.<br>
      <br>
It turns out that criterion for success item 1 is pretty much
impossible; even the professional outfits warn against having the
projector in line with the viewer. <br>

<h2>Front Projection Again</h2>
<br>So, back we go. This time I bought a sheet of (wth is it called) and stuck that on the front of the frame<br>
&lt;picture of that&gt;<br>
<br>
The surface is very smooth and once the image is projected on it you cannot see its texture at all. <br>
The projector setup now has the camera almost in line with the projector.<br>
&lt;picture of setup&gt;<br>
<br>
The screen is set to half the angle between the projector and camera
and of course you still get the keystone effect, but this is easily
corrected in software. As you can see the frame not only needs
perspective correction but the result needs to be cropped. <br>

<h1>Some Early Results</h1>

A film reel came with the projector and I've been using it to develop
the system. It's in fairly rough shape so I don't feel too guilty about
the creases, breaks and melting. The film is full of scratches and
spots so it'll be good test data for when I get into software scratch
removal. It's from 1957 and is quite interesting
in its own right. Here's a clip. You can see the capture of the
preceding and following frames. This is because I enlarged the hole
behind the film that the light comes through.<br>

<h1><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId982964"></a>Choosing a Camera</h1>
There's no contest - use a digital SLR. One thing that blew me away
when I got my Canon was how much better the pictures were compared to
my point-and-shoot. Megapixels is only part of it; the two biggest
other factors are:<br>
<br>
1. The size of the image sensor. Most point and shoot cameras have an
image sensor size of around 7mm by 5mm. DSLRs have a sensor of around
25 x 16 mm, about 11 times the area and light collecting ability. Each
sensor "pixel" is proportionately larger in the DSLR, which means it
collects more light information in proportion to its natural sources of
interference (such as electronic noise) and can present a truer
representation of the received color.<br>
<br>
2. Optics. The lenses in a DSLR are of much higher quality than those
of a point-and-shoot, and you pay accordingly.<br>
<br>
There's another benefit of DSLR over point-and-shoot in this
application; you can power off the camera without affecting the focus
and zoom. Point-and-shoot cameras retract the lens on power down and
redeploy when the camera is turned on again. You cannot be sure that
you set the zoom exactly the same way as you had it before, and in the
finished video that will show as a sudden zoom change that is very
noticeable. On the DSLR zoom and focus can be set manually and are
unaffected by the camera being turned off.<br>
<br>
Of course that's easy for me to say; I have a DSLR. If that's beyond
your budget then any point-and-shoot will do the job with varying
degrees of quality, all of which will beat the store-bought conversion
products. You need to be able to digitize a
complete film without powering down the camera or running out of
storage, plus it needs a remote control. <br>
